# Accelerate Playgrounds!

This is collection of Swift playgrounds that illustrate how to leverage Apple's Accelerate framework in Swift for performance.

Currently these are for Xcode 11 / Swift 5 and above. (Check out earlier versions if you have an older system. It started out as a Swift 2.x project.)

Learn and have fun, but please don't just plagiarize and present the work as your own (this happened to this playground, in fact). If you use the code for an article or similar, you must make sure to include due credit to this author and a link back to this repository. Ideally, make up your own completely different set of examples. Contribute to the community.


Many thanks to [Brad Howes](https://github.com/bradhowes) and [Rahul Bhalley](https://github.com/rahulbhalley) for their fixes to bring it up to date with Swift 5; very much appreciated.
