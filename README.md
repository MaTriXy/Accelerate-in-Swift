This is an updated fork of [Jeff Biggus'](https://github.com/hyperjeff) excellent
[Accelerate-in-Swift](https://github.com/hyperjeff/Accelerate-in-Swift) collection of Swift playgrounds that 
illustrate how to leverage Apple's Accelerate framework in Swift for performance.

The patch requests I and [Rahul Bhalley](https://github.com/rahulbhalley) submitted allow the playgrounds to run in 
Xcode 11 / Swift 5. This fork contains the updates.

Below is from Jeff's page:

# Accelerate Playgrounds!

These files require Xcode 7.3 / Swift 2.x and above.

Learn and have fun, but please don't just plagiarize and present the work as your own (this happened to this playground, in fact). If you use the code for an article or similar, you must make sure to include due credit to this author and a link back to this repository. Ideally, make up your own completely different set of examples. Contribute to the community.
