# Accelerate Playgrounds!

These files require Xcode 7.3 / Swift 2.x and above.

Learn and have fun, but please don't just plagiarize and present the work as your own (this happened to this playground, in fact). If you use the code for an article or similar, you must make sure to include due credit to this author and a link back to this repository. Ideally, make up your own completely different set of examples. Contribute to the community.
